# Food Ordering App

Food ordering application using Monaca, React and Framework 7, as well as the Firebase database.

The customer can select meals and beverages and choose delivery or dine-in option. If delivery is chosen, the user fills name and email, and geolocation is acquired. In case of dine-in, user chooses date and table. Next is payment (cash or card), where payment by card is done through Stripe.
